    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>"Because this meal is so simple and doesn't need much to make it stellar, all you need is four ingredients: onions, garlic, soy sauce, and rice vinegar and the prep is almost as simple as the recommended method on the package." —Keaton Larson</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion or ½ medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 package Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Chicken</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>Sliced green onions (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent. Add the chicken from the package of Mandarin Orange Chicken to the skillet with the onion and toss to coat the chicken in the oil. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the orange sauce from the package of Mandarin Orange Chicken to a small saucepan over low heat until hot.</li>
        <li>Combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and water in a small bowl. Add the mixture to the skillet with the chicken and cook, stirring and scraping the bits off the bottom of the pan, for about 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the hot orange sauce.</li>
